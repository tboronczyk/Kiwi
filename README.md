This is the file README for the Kiwi Programming Language distribution.

Kiwi is my on-going "forever Project" to implement a programming language from
scratch. Not only a learning opportunity, it also serves as a playground to
explore issues in programming language design.

Kiwi probably won't be useful to anyone other than me, especially at the rate
I get to work on it, but the code is licensed as free software. You can
redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the license provided in
the LICENSE file.

Comments
========
Kiwi supports single-line and multi-line comments. Single-line comments start 
with `//` and end with the end of the line. Multi-line comments start with `/*`
and end with `*/`. Nested multi-line comments are supported. Both styles of
comments are ignored by the parser so they may appear anywhere in a source
file.

Assignment, Equality, and Identity
==================================
The assignment operator is `:=`. The equality operator is `=`.  The  keyword
`is` is used for identity tests (strong equality). See the Variable Declaration
and Boolean Logic sections for more information.

Numeric Literals
================
Numeric literals may be specified in a variety of styles. Standard integers are 
written as bare literals (for example, the integer value forty-two is `42`).
Floats must have at least one decimal place (forty-two as a float is written
`42.0`).

Expressing integers in non-decimal bases is possible as well, such as base 2,
8, and 16. The radix is written first followed by `#` and then the value which
may only contain the valid digits for the selected radix. The radix portion may
be omitted, in wich case hexadecimal is assumed. The integer value forty-two
can thus be written in binary as `2#101010`, in octal as `8#52`, and headecimal
as either `16#2A` or `#2A`.

String Literals
===============
String literals are enclosed by quotation marks. The following escape sequences
are recognized within a string:

 - `\n`          newline
 - `\r`          carriage return
 - `\t`          horizontal tab
 - `\\`          backslash
 - `\"`          double quote

Identifiers
===========
Valid identifiers start with a letter or underscore and may contain a mix of
letters, underscores, and numbers. If the programmer wishes to use an identifier
that is the same as a reserved word, they may prefix the identifier with a
backtick.

Variable Declaration
====================
Variables must be declared before they are used with the keyword `var`.
Kiwi allows multiple variables to be declared with one `var` and the identifiers
separated by commas.

...

Conditional Branching
=====================
The keywords `if` and `else` are used to write conditional branches of code. 
...

Boolean Logic
=============
The operators `&&`, `||`, and `^^` are logical-and, logical-or, and logical-xor
respectively. They return the Boolean values `true` or `false` and their behavior
is short-circuiting. `~` is logical-not, and `~=` is not-equals.

The `=` operator tests for equality between values, and `is` is used for
identity tests. They too return Boolean `true` or `false`.

...

Examples
========
    // generate the Nth Fibonacci number 
    func fibonacci n { 
        var m, p, r.
        if n < 2 { 
            return n.
        } 
        m := fibonacci(n - 1).
        p := fibonacci(n - 2).
        r := m + p.
        return r.
    }
    var i := 1, fib.
    while i <= 10 { 
        fib := fibonacci(i).
        print(fib).
        i := i + 1.
    }


    // escaped identifier, binary literal, and nested comment
    var `var := 2#100.
    if `var > 10 {
        /* greater than 10 */
        print("value is greater than 10").
    }
    else if `var < 0 {
        /* negative */
        print("negative value").
    }
    /*
    else {
        /* less than 10 */
        print("value less or equal to 10").
    }
    */
