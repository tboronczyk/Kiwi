## Language Constructs

### Comments

Both single and multiple-line comments are supported. Single-line comments
begin with `//` and span to the end of the current line. Multiple-line
comments open with `/*` and close with `*/`. It is possible to nest 
multiple-line comments.

    // this is a single-line comment

    /* this is a multiple-line comment
    that spans multiple lines. It also
    /* this is a nested comment */
    allows nested comments. */
